  [PetaBencana.id](https://docs.petabencana.id/v/master-1) by the
  [Climate Emergency Software Alliance (CESA)](https://cesa.global/)
  is a free and transparent platform for emergency response and
  disaster management in megacities in South and Southeast Asia. The platform
  harnesses the heightened use of social media during emergency events to
  gather, sort, and display confirmed hazard information in real-time.

  The platform adopts a “people are the best sensors” paradigm, where confirmed
  reports are collected directly from the users at street level in a manner
  that removes expensive and time-consuming data processing. This framework
  creates accurate, real-time data which is immediately made available for
  users and first responders.

  PetaBencana.id gathers, sorts, and visualizes data using specially developed
  CogniCity Open Source Software, to transform the noise of social and digital
  media into critical information for residents, communities, and government
  agencies.
